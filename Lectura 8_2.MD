In this paper, the authors present the SetFusion, a visual user-controllable interface for hybrid recommender system. SetFusion has got three parts which includes an interactive Venn Diagram and a set of sliders to make the fusion process transparent, controllable, and explorable and ranked list views. Then they implemented SetFusion in the shape of conference support system (CN3) so as to evaluate the visual controlled hybridization value. After that they performed two field studies of the system at academic conferences CSCW 2013 and UMAP 2013. While their UMAP study evaluates the impact of SetFusion in natural settings, The CSCW study is comparing the effect of SetFusion with a traditional ranked list. Finally, they compared their study results and obtained that SetFusion in a natural recommendation mode had a positive effect on the user experience.

They presented a SetFusion Interface Interactions with three parts that makes it interesting. So, it is positive point for this paper especially part of Sliders widget which is easy to use. Therefore, this part provides access quickly with ease and without frustration. But in my opinion the part of Venn diagram widget for a novice user or for a person who has not had work experiences (unseen by the novice user) with the interface like that needs to some explanations and educations to use it. So, I think that it is kind of demerit for the interface because it could not have the condition of Perceived Ease of Use. They should have provided some interfaces which was efficient for all kinds of users from novices to experts. For example, imagine that there is a student who wants to search some articles and does not have any information about Venn diagram. So, according to Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design (10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design), the interface could not provide condition of Flexibility and efficiency of use.

Moreover, although they expressed their SetFusion interface is controllable, when users choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “reset all of user’s setting (user’s manipulations)” to leave unwanted state whether are there this option or not? (For example, basically undo and redo bottom). But I can assume that there is this option about part of Sliders widget. Because users to some extent can change their settings by moving the sliders (or typing a number in the textbox) that makes it positive point and shows that it is controllable but being controllable is not clear in the part of Venn diagram. Because they did not point out it when a user wants to have several clicks on an area inside the Venn diagram (C-1) and after click on one the circles to search several researches subject, what will happen? Can they have some controllable similar to undo or redo? I assume no. Therefore, according to Nielsen’s ten usability heuristics, User Control & Freedom for an interface is necessary and the SetFusion interface could not fulfil it in pat of Venn diagram.

Furthermore, one of the another demerit of the paper is that there is a recall interface instead of a recognition interface in the their SetFusion interface in the part of Venn diagram widget. Recognition is to minimize the user's memory load by making icons, objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the concepts or some subjects in their mind. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. First of all, when a user faces it first time, some mathematical subjects are reminded about union and intersection that diverts user’s mind to other concepts that are not relevant to usage of Venn diagram in this paper. Secondly, Venn diagram widget is recall. Because using the Venn diagram to search is not an icon, objects or action common visible for users. Recall interfaces like their Venn diagram leads to maximize user work to remember information. So, it is not good for a successful interface because recall is difficult and error-prone for users. Therefore, they should have used some recognize icons or objects visible interfaces that promote recognition give users extra help in remembering information and minimized user work which is essential for a good user experience. However, it is positive point that they used Sliders widget which is recognition. Because they used a visible common icon which makes it easily retrievable whenever appropriate for users by moving the sliders or typing a number in the textbox.

Furthermore, in the part of List of talks recommended, when user hover over color bar, obtaining an explanation of the method used to recommend the paper.  It is kind of merit because their SetFusion interface allows users to understand why an article is recommended to them. In fact, they could provide transparency for users. Transparency has a certain impact on other critical aspects of users’ perception and it shows that the more transparent a recommended paper is the more likely users would be to visit the interface and introduce it to their friends.
