In this paper, they surveyed content-based recommendation systems. They explained Item Representation that dived some parts: structured, unstructured data and semi-structured data. They explained that attributes and restricted of them. Then they stated User Profiles which are may consist of types of information such as a model of the user’s preferences and a history of the user’s interactions with the recommendation system. Then they illustrated learning a user model via a model of the user’s preference from the user history is a form of classification learning. They introduced Decision Trees and Rule Induction and explained that how to classify the context of text then RIPPER approach is stated that it optimizes the fit of the induced rule set. Therefore, Nearest Neighbor Methods was explained to how to label items. They explained some classification algorithms such as Rocchio’s Algorithm, Linear Classifiers, Probabilistic Methods and Naïve Bayes. Finally, they surveyed some limitations and extensions in content-based recommendation system.

On the one hand, it is kind of merit because they converted free text to a structured representation. In fact, they can calculate the number of times the word appears in the article. But in my opinion, in some languages like Spanish that there a lots of el or la in sentences. The method probably will calculate high number of these el or la that the number of them are not important. Maybe the number of these word equal to the number of keywords. Because they used an el or la behind of each keyword. So I think that it disturbs their calculations.

Another positive method that the authors explained process of stemming. In fact, using the root forms of words helps to calculate exactly the number of frequently of a word in spite of the fact that one word probably can repeat with several kinds of form. In fact, stemming can prevent counting repetitive words in form of verb, adjective, noun and so on. All of the kind of words are assumed same. But this question forms in my mind that does this method work for any kinds of languages? For example, there are some language such as Persian or Arabic. The structure of these kinds of languages are very different to English in terms of finding root form of these word and even these kinds of languages are written from right to left!

The authors introduced and explained some of classification algorithms well. Those are understandable for me. But if they had some examples for each Formula, it could be more useful.

On the other hand, In part of history of the user’s interactions with the recommendation system. There should have been an opportunity for a user’s profile to stop some repetitive recommendations. For example, when a user buys an item after buying he does not want to get recommended items similar to an item that he bought already again. It makes users boring. The authors did not consider to that.  Considering to that subject can employ a recommendation system in order to improve seller’s revenue by, e.g., enhancing cross-sell and improve utility for recommended systems. For instance, they could have assigned a check boxes to user’s profile that they could show that they bought an especial item already. Then a model can learn from the user’s profile to not recommend a repetitive item.
