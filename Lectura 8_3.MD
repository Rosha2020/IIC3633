In this paper, the authors provided an online user experiment with a Facebook music recommender system that users can control and inspect over the recommendations. 267 participants were recruited using Craigslist and Amazon Mechanical Turk that they were just adult Facebook users living in the U.S. then they studied the effect of presence of inspectability and control to interact with their system. Finally, they expressed that inspectability and control grows users’ perceived understanding of and control over the system, their rating of the recommendation quality, and their satisfaction with the system.

On the one hand, in view the fact they focused on inspectability and control in their system, it is necessary to survey the interface in terms of being recognition or recall, being controllable and freedom for user and etc. As they implied their interface is recognition rather than recall, it is kind of merit, because they could provide an interface which has Consistency and standards. In fact, they used some boxes that user can click on those and see how her-his likes are linked to her-his friends. These kind of interface like the boxes are common to use. When users face those, they do not be wonder from different icons, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Consequently, users do not have to remember information from one part in their mind. In fact, their interface is visible or easy retrievable which is the important condition to be recognition. Furthermore, by using full graph condition users can see which friends are connected to the recommendations that allow users to recognize more of the recommendations as already known.

Moreover, another positive point for this interface is to be flexibility and efficiency of use. Because as I mentioned they used some simple icons like boxes which has created conditions that using it can be feasible and useful for all of kinds of user ranging from novices and experts. Therefore, it can meet the participants’ understandability with the system.

Also, users can adjust the value of their likes for using the system. In my opinion, it is kind of merit. Because it can show the level of controllable and freedom of a system. For example, there is a person with a character who accustoms to change her/his opinion about her/his favorite. So, being controllable and freedom in a system help users to change the unwanted state. Finally, it can be useful to increase satisfaction’s users with the system.

On the other hand, in my opinion, one of the negative point for this paper is that they studied just Facebook users who live in the U.S. Because it is kind of biases. To have a fair survey, they should have distributed their studies in some various country. Because maybe the user’s internationality and different user’s thoughts would be another effective factor in the values of participants’ satisfaction in their system.

Moreover, in the paper the authors surveyed being controllable of the system more than being inpectability. In my opinion the part of being inpectability is a little weak. For example, when a user hover over Svetlin’s music, friends on Facebook and recommendations boxes, they should have created a text box to write why do the recommendation recommend to a user? It could be kind of transparency factor that could be attractive for users and help to persons who are very curious. Because as they told in the paper personal characteristics is one of the effective factor in their studies.

In conclusion, I think that results of the paper are inevitable. Because they were proving that having factors of inpectability and construability for a system have positive influences on users’ perceived understanding of and control over the system, their satisfaction with the system and their rating of the recommendation quality. Just they showed some comparisons and statistics to demonstrate it. they do not have any interesting result that makes me wonderful. To make some complicated thing they could have investigated the algorithm computational complexity which they used. For example, does their proposed algorithm present an appropriate and speed computational complexity?
