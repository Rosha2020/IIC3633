In this paper, in view of the fact that there a lot of recommendation algorithms, it is necessary to select the best of them from a set of candidates according to requests of the application. Thus, they studied those algorithms in terms of evaluation metrics. Then they expressed some existence problems that it will be essential to be addressed when designing offline and online experiments and user studies. In addition, they implied some important measurements that should be pay attention to design for any kinds of experiments in recommendation algorithms. Then they surveyed a range of properties that are commonly considered to make a decision which recommendation approach to choice according to needs of the applications. Then they implied several Measuring Ratings Prediction Accuracy and explained which one is suitable for different conditions(application). Finally, they expressed a variety of properties of recommendation systems which influence on user experience. 

On the one hand, they considered two dimension of offline and online experiment in part of prediction accuracy such as RMSE, in Ranking Measures and some properties of recommendation systems. They could compare two kinds of the dimensions and explained which the prediction accuracy is more suitable for online experiment and vice versa. I think that it is positive point for this paper because majority of papers have studied just online experiments. 

They expressed various biases in this paper and emphasized to avoid them have trade-offs between them. In addition, they explained the Robustness as a recommendation systems properties. In my opinion, the subject of robustness (presence of fake information and large number of requests) not only can be recommendation systems properties but also can be study as a kind of bias. Because entering fake rating makes unfair distribution in ratings and users. These are kinds of biases. Also, when a previous user obverses fake ratings, it influences on the user opinion of the current result. In addition, presence of large number of requests create biases. When there are more requests than real population, there can be significant effect on their experiment result.

In general, in my opinion this paper can be a suitable reference to read and learn some concepts because the authors have explained and analyze these concepts well.

On the other hand, they introduced and explained a lot of recommendation systems properties, but if the system is designed to recommend items to sell. there can be an another condition that a user buys an item from an online store and he receives that item. Then he decided to refund that item because he does not like that. So after visiting that online store to buy another item, the store should not recommend him the same item that he has refunded. In fact, this recommendation will be offended for him. So I think that this condition is common but they did not consider it and this condition is relevant to property of diversity. I think if this condition is considered, it can have significant effect on successful and quality of recommendation systems.

The authors they explained two kinds of robustness as I expressed above. In my opinion one of the other types of robustness is privacy contravention. In fact, there can be found a third party who changes the principal preferencesâ€™ user. So, it makes fake information. 

The authors implied that there are two scenarios for Online evaluation of ranking. But I think that there can found another scenario like this the reference list can contain unknown items, preference items, unreferenced items respectively. Why they did not consider scenario 3? I believe that it can be useful to make serendipity and novelty.
