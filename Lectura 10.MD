In this paper, the authors provided a survey to review literatures which include a bunch of advanced topics of deep learning based recommender system. They reviewed recommendation models based on deep learning techniques in terms of semantic. First of all, they had overview of recommender system and deep learning and studied reasons why deep neural networks are used for recommendations. Secondly, they pointed out drawbacks and limitations with using deep learning for recommendation. They explained some of state-of-the-arts categories of deep learning based recommendation models, multilayer perceptron based recommendation, auto-encoder based recommendation and convolutional neural networks based recommendation. Finally, they studied challenges, issues (weakness) and strength point of the algorithms and compared together.

They explained nine algorithms in the part of deep learning techniques briefly. But I think that they should studied about that each of the algorithms is suitable and the best for which kind of area in machine learning. For example, autoencoders techniques work best in feature detection, setting up a compelling recommendation model and add features to large datasets. In addition, they wrote some explanations about autoencoders and mentioned types of autoencoders such denoising autoencoder, marginalized denoising and etc. But they did not have any explanation about the types of autoencoders. So, it is kind of demerit for the survey.

Furthermore, in view of the fact that they have collected a lot of information about topics of deep learning based recommender system, this survey is a learning reference for readers so I think when readers are reading this survey and have enough information about deep learning and recommender systems topics, they should not need to search the topics on google or other webpages. But I think that it is negative point for the survey because the readers need to search some topics like I mentioned in above paragraph. So, they should have explained some subjects with more details such as a feed-forward neural network and activation functions before part of deep learning techniques.

Moreover,they studied convolutional neural networks based Recommendation in part of feature representation learning with CNNs from multiple sources such as image with more details such as CNNs for Image Feature Extraction. In my opinion, they could explain the concepts well. But I think that they should also have added some other kinds of methods such as U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet) Image for post, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and High Resolution Net (HRNet). I believe that to have a completed survey they should have pointed out those methods because it is difficult to tell which one is better than another and which one is the best choice in a specific project. Frankly speaking, all the discussed architectures are powerful and a natural recommendation is to use them in the ascending order of difficulty of implementation. Especially for real-life projects, it is the diversity of training data, rather than the bells and whistles of the architectures, that can make a difference to the model performance.

Also, in the page of 7 there is an incomplete sentence that it has been started with a “this” and then the sentence has been left without continuance. Furthermore, in page of 8 there is a word that has been repeated twice consecutively which is “ we we”. So I think that it is negative point for the authors because it is kind of careless in their paper.

However, the tables have been used to show that the references of any methods and concepts in the paper for example, table of Deep neural network based recommendation models in specific application fields which is kind of merit of the paper because they could provide references to access for readers rapidly.  
In general, I think that the authors provided a good opportunity for readers to access the important concepts as a big reference.
