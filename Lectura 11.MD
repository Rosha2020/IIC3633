In second part of the paper, they explained RNNs which are two fold such as Session-based Recommendation without User Identifier, Sequential Recommendation with User Identifier and Feature Representation Learning with RNNs. Then they collected some proposed model or algorithms which are as related works. After that the Restricted Boltzmann Machine based Recommendation was studied with its parameters. Then they classified a Neural Attention based Recommendation to Recommendation with Vanilla Attention and Recommendation with Co-Attention. Then, Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator is introduced as a tractable distribution estimator which provides a desirable alternative to RBM. In the next part, Deep Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation are studied and there are some interesting proposed such as a news recommendation system with DRL. After that the general framework of IRGAN are studied with two parts like generative retrieval and discriminative retrieval. Finally, they presented some concepts and proposed some models about Deep Hybrid Models for Recommendation, Cross Domain Recommendation with that and so on.

In the part of CNNs and Autoencoder, they introduced the CKE employs SDAE to learn feature representations from textual information. I think that it could be more interested, if they should have added somethings like that; suppose that there are some sentences in English or Spanish, we want to determine which word is subject, object, noun, adjective or so on for any sentence to help to persons who want to learn additional languages. In my opinion by using SDAE we can propose a new model to train these features from these sentences (textual) and it can consider item text information to specify the wordâ€™ position in a sentence(being subject, noun.etc). Because the part of writing criticisms(here) is not suitable part to explain and analyze my idea, I explained one my ideas in next paragraph in details. 

Furthermore, it can be other scenario that can be used SDAE that could be one part of a proposed model of this paper. Suppose that there is a knowledgeable text and there are some questions like (being true or false of some sentences) that their answers are inside of the text. So, we need a model to analyze the text. For example, a model which can bold some keywords, numbers, name of places or persons and so on. Therefore, in view of the fact that SDAE is employed to learn from the text, by using this method we can answer the question that I explained above. In fact, a SDAE with an unsupervised pre-training process is firstly used to establish load forecasting model. The training process of the entire network is divided into two phases: unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.  In the unsupervised pre-training process, the unsupervised pre-training can learn about the features of representations from the text. Each DAE is trained iteratively layer by layer. Then, the weights of encoder part w and hidden layer values y are combined with original input values x to form a four-layer SDAE network, including an input layer (weights of the bolded keywords, numbers, name of places and persons), two hidden layers (analyze the being True or False sentences as questions), and an output layer (answering to the questions). In the fine-tuning process, the complete network is further trained to minimize the error based on the actual and forecast load values.

In general, if they could an example to explain more about any method, it could be help more to readers to understanding more about details of any proposed algorithms.
